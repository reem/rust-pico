> Nonblocking asynchronous push-parser for HTTP powered by picohttpparser.

## Overview

Implement the Chunks trait for your data source, then use either
`RequestParser` or `ResponseParser` to painlessly parse your data
as an HTTP request or response.

## Usage

Use the crates.io repository; add this to your `Cargo.toml` along
with the rest of your dependencies:

```toml
[dependencies]
pico = "*"
```
